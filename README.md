# Crowdsourced Cartographic Catastrophe Analysis (CCCA)

CCCA, or Crowdsourced Cartographic Catastrophe Analysis, is a powerful tool for social good that leverages real-time data from social media. It uses the frequency of tweets with location enabled and keywords relevant to natural disasters to form a heatmap from which first responders and helpers can decide which areas are most in need of assistance. Developed for TAMUhack by the Waitlisters.
